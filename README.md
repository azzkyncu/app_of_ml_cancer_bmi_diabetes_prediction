Title: Applications of Machine Learning in Cancer, Blood Pressure and Diabetes Prediction

Purpose: The purpose of this project is to utilize ML algorithms to predict cancer, blood pressure, and diabetes based on behaviors, demographics, and diseases.

Data source: Survey conducted by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. It was obtained from Kaggle

Tools:Random Forest & Extreme Gradient Boost (XGB): Tree-based classification algorithms consisting of many decision trees.

-Accuracy: model accuracy is very simplistic # acc pred/ total prediction

-Confusion matrix: is used to describe the performance of the model.
